<P> Get off my dick, get off my dick


But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (Whoa, okay)
East Atlanta playboy
Don't got much to say, boy
Cradle to the grave, and it's been like that since a slave, boy
It ain't shit to pull up, pick the fucking tool up
Screaming hallelujah, pushing daisies and some tulips (Hi guys, hi, hi, hi)
Itty bitty bitch, niggas in the city with it, pull up with a stick
Thirty with the dick

But I got the bungees, I'ma jump off this ship (Hey)
But I bet he get whipped with the pistol grip (Okay, okay)
Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shit (Okay, okay, okay)
Legend out the 2-6 (Whoa)
  <br>Y'all know who the truth is (Whoa)
Crazy like a movie by that nigga Stanley Kubrick (Whoa)
Perfect time to pop up (Whoa)
Wet you like the hot tub (Whoa)
Clean up Aisle 7, damn somebody gettin' mopped up (Whoa)
Pull up on the block, eeny, meeny, miny, moe
You and every nigga that you know is getting popped
Fuckin' with a nigga, ass sitting in the box
Tryna sneak diss, then I'm pickin' up the Glock
I squeeze this, they be pickin' up the top
Styles, Sheek, Kiss, yeah, I'm pickin' all the locks
Pickin' on a nigga way bigger, then I got
Bigger than the nigga that was Kindergarten Cop
Terminator shit, I'm a robot

  With the chrome .45 that most don't got
  <img src="img/king kunta.jpeg" alt="">
  One false move, get your moto shot
Turn a nigga whip to a photo op
Click, click, click, and the flows don't stop

Nigga talkin' that shit, now I'm talkin' my shitAnd now
My niggas
Our future presentation

  <br>And, uh, as I lay myself to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
The pressure makes me, the journey takes me
To places where history can't stop or break me
You know it rains for somethin', you know the pain's for somethin'
  <br>I hope a change is comin', just keep on swangin' on
  <br>Swang on, swang on (oh, swang on), swang on, swang on (swang on)

Keep on swangin' lil' sis, keep swangin' lil' bro
I'm 'bout to swang on Terry Payne because he said my sister ho
  <br>Gettin' high from Swisher Sweets, chariots are swingin' low
Swastikas and the police, hang a nigga, swangin' rope
Peewee tried to swang on me
But I was with like fifty folks and he ain't know
  <br>But what was worse, I aint't even want no beef with bro
We was toted, we was soldiers, we was soulless
We was sold and sayin' somethin' 'bout his set
Nigga, that who he swangin' for
Swear you bitches don't know shit about our stress, about our woes

Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on </P>
<h3>about</h3>
<h4> And my obsession with success by definition of my own
Sure as death is waitin on our flesh and bones
Demon callin my spirit, had to click the phone
Couldn't get to Courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
Told her, "You like the strongest woman on the fuckin' globe

  <br>Sure as death is waitin' on our flesh and bones
Demon callin' my spirit, had to click the phone
Couldn't get to Courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
Told her, "You like the strongest woman on the fuckin' globe"
I watch my momma lose her momma
Go through drama and trauma but had to keep her head high
So we don't fuckin' know, I'm gettin' older
So when the world's feelin' enormous on your back and on your arms
And your feet just as heavy you have been dragging' through the storm
Staring' at the city, but you trapped inside a hole
Get your back up off the ropes, keep swangin' on (yeah)</h4>
